#  HTML, CSS, JavaScript Mini Projects

This repository is a collection of projects built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. These projects were developed to strengthen my frontend development skills and cover a wide range of core JS concepts like DOM manipulation, events, conditions, functions, arrays, etc.

Some of these projects are inspired by a structured Udemy course, and others are original projects built out of practice and experimentation.
